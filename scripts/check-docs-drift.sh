# Audits the canonical docs (AGENTS.md + docs/*.md) against the tree they describe.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The docs here are load-bearing: an agent reads them before the code, and the repo deliberately
#   keeps long-lived records instead of deleting them. Records rot silently — a renamed path, a
#   `file.php:NNN` that now lands on a blank line after an edit above it, a hooks table that lost an
#   entry. None of that fails anything, which is why it survives. This checks the mechanically
#   checkable part; whether a paragraph is still *true* stays a human judgement.
#
# WHY NOT A PHPUNIT TEST
#   The unit suite runs with `src/trunk` as its world (that is all the dev container mounts, and all
#   the release build copies). AGENTS.md and docs/ live above it, so a test would skip exactly where
#   the suite normally runs — a guard that never fires. Here the repo root exists by construction.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check-docs-drift.sh
# No Docker, no dev stack, no network. Exits non-zero on any finding.
